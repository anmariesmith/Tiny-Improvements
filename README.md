# Tiny Improvements - MongoDB and Mongoose

## Overview
For this project, I built an application that allows users to send compliments or "Kudos" to other users that are then displayed on the page for all to see. I used a MongoDB database to store all Kudos and User data which will then be output onto the DOM.
